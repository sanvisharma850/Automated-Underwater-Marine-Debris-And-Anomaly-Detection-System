## Abstract

This repository presents an end-to-end, edge-deployable computer vision system for the automated detection, classification, and geolocation of anthropogenic marine debris and other seabed anomalies in side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery. The system combines a lightweight convolutional object-detection backbone (YOLOv8n), an acoustically-motivated image preprocessing pipeline, a physics-based acoustic-shadow height-estimation module, and a trigonometric geotagging engine that projects pixel-space detections into WGS-84 geographic coordinates. Results are surfaced through a full-stack operator dashboard comprising a FastAPI inference backend and a React-based mission-control frontend, enabling near-real-time triage of hydrographic survey data without dependence on cloud connectivity. The project was developed in response to Problem Statement 26057 of the Smart India Hackathon 2026, under the Disaster Management theme, with a specific focus on the identification of "ghost nets" — abandoned or lost fishing gear that represents one of the most persistent and destructive forms of marine pollution.

---

## 1. Background and Motivation

The accumulation of anthropogenic debris in marine ecosystems constitutes a critical and escalating threat to global biodiversity. Among the most destructive categories of marine pollution are ghost nets — abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear that continues to entangle and kill marine organisms, damage coral reef structures, and pose navigational hazards to commercial and naval vessels long after being lost at sea.

Owing to the vastness, depth, and optical opacity of the ocean environment, marine conservationists and hydrographic surveyors rely on side-scan sonar instrumentation — towed behind survey vessels or mounted on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) — to construct detailed acoustic maps of the seafloor. The manual review of these sonar logs, however, is a labor-intensive process: a single survey may generate tens of hours of acoustic waterfall data, and debris signatures frequently resemble natural geological features such as rock outcrops, sand ripples, and sediment ridges, making manual interpretation slow, subjective, and error-prone.

This project automates that interpretive process through computer vision, with the objective of reliably distinguishing artificial anomalies from natural seafloor topology, and of doing so under computational constraints compatible with onboard AUV or marine-drone deployment — that is, without a mandatory dependency on high-bandwidth cloud infrastructure.

## 2. Objectives

The system was designed to satisfy four functional requirements central to the problem statement:

1. **Detection / Segmentation** — An AI/ML architecture capable of localizing man-made objects (shipwrecks, pipelines, cylinders, and entangled debris nets) within raw sonar imagery via bounding boxes.
2. **Confidence Scoring and Noise Filtering** — A processing pipeline that suppresses false positives arising from acoustic shadows or natural rock clustering, and that reports a calibrated confidence score for every retained detection.
3. **Anomaly Reporting and Geotagging** — A metadata-aware reporting engine that converts pixel-space detections into structured, geolocated records (JSON/CSV) suitable for downstream GIS consumption.
4. **Interactive Dashboard** — A visual interface permitting log ingestion, real-time overlay of detections on a geospatial map, and export of mission reports.


---

## 3. Proposed Solution


The proposed solution is an end-to-end AUV/drone-mounted perception pipeline that converts raw side-scan sonar waterfall imagery into actionable, geotagged detections, engineered to execute on the vehicle itself rather than requiring a round-trip to cloud infrastructure.

**Processing pipeline:**

```
Sonar Imagery → CLAHE Contrast Normalization → YOLOv8n Object Detection
   → Acoustic-Shadow Height Estimation → Anomaly Classification
      → Geotagged Mission Report
```

At the class level, the detector distinguishes the following anomaly categories: **Shipwreck**, **Pipe**, **Cylinder**, **Ghost Net**, and generic **Debris**.

### 3.1 How the System Addresses the Problem

- Manual review of hydrographic sonar footage can require tens of hours per survey. The trained detector executes in approximately **2 ms per image** on CPU, enabling near-real-time triage during the mission itself rather than in post-processing.
- The system prioritizes the highest-hazard classes — ghost nets and shipwrecks — by attaching a confidence score to every detection, allowing cleanup and navigation teams to act on the most critical targets first.

### 3.2 Innovation and Distinguishing Characteristics

- **Compact detector**: A sub-7 MB, 8.1 GFLOP YOLOv8n model, validated across three independent, publicly available datasets (Seabed, AI4Shipwreck, and Marine Pulse) rather than a single train/test split.
- **Physics-based height estimation**: Object height is recovered from acoustic-shadow geometry rather than inferred solely from a 2D bounding box, using the classical hydrographic relation between slant range, shadow length, and vehicle altitude.
- **Synthetic sonar data generation**: A synthetic-texture studio is included to partially offset the scarcity of labeled, real-world sonar debris imagery.
- **Transparent per-class validation**: Reported metrics are broken down by dataset and class, with an explicit account of where the model performs reliably and where it does not (Section 7).

## 4. System Architecture


<p align="center">
  <img src="asset/WhatsApp Image 2026-09-04 at 11.32.45 PM.jpeg" width="700"/>
</p>


The system is composed of two cooperating tiers:

- **Backend Perception Engine** (`backend/`) — A Python/FastAPI service responsible for image preprocessing, ONNX-based model inference, acoustic-shadow height computation, and coordinate geotagging.
- **Frontend Mission Workstation** (`frontend/`) — A React 19 single-page application providing live sonar visualization, interactive analysis tooling, GIS mapping, and report generation.

### 4.1 End-to-End Pipeline

1. **Sonar Log and Telemetry Ingestion** — The system accepts raw side-scan sonar image logs (PNG/JPEG) together with AUV navigation telemetry: vehicle latitude, longitude, heading, and swath width.
2. **Acoustic Preprocessing** (`backend/src/preprocessing/engine.py`)
   - *Speckle noise suppression* via edge-preserving median filtering, to attenuate acoustic reverberation and backscatter noise while preserving object boundaries.
   - *Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)* to normalize gain variation across the sonar scanline without saturating low-intensity shadow regions.
   - *Acoustic shadow enhancement* via gamma-curve remapping (γ = 1.5) to improve the visibility of shadows cast by seafloor targets — a key discriminative cue for object height estimation.
3. **Detection Engine** (`backend/src/model/inference.py`)
   - Object detection is performed by a YOLOv8n backbone, exported to ONNX and executed via ONNX Runtime (`weights/best.onnx`).
   - The engine incorporates an automatic fallback ("mock") mode that returns a synthetic demonstration detection when model weights are unavailable, ensuring the API and frontend remain functionally testable in the absence of a bound model artifact.
4. **Acoustic-Shadow Height Estimation**

   Target height is estimated from the geometry of the acoustic shadow cast on the seafloor, corrected for vehicle pitch and roll:

   $$H_{\text{target}} = \frac{L_{\text{shadow}} \times \left(H_{\text{altitude}} \cdot \cos(\theta_{\text{pitch}}) \cdot \cos(\theta_{\text{roll}})\right)}{R_{\text{slant}} + L_{\text{shadow}}}$$

   where $L_{\text{shadow}}$ is the measured shadow length, $H_{\text{altitude}}$ is the vehicle's altitude above the seafloor, $R_{\text{slant}}$ is the slant range to the target, and $\theta_{\text{pitch}}, \theta_{\text{roll}}$ are the instantaneous vehicle attitude angles.

5. **Geotagging and Coordinate Projection** (`backend/src/utils/geotag.py`)
   - Pixel-space bounding-box centroids are converted to metric across-track ($X$) and along-track ($Y$) offsets using the known swath width and image resolution.
   - A heading-corrected 2D rotation is applied, and the result is projected onto the WGS-84 ellipsoid model (111,320 m per degree of latitude, adjusted for longitude by $\cos(\text{latitude})$) to yield the absolute latitude/longitude of each detected object.
6. **Interactive Presentation** (`frontend/src/`) — Detections, confidence scores, and geographic coordinates are rendered in the live waterfall view, the GIS tactical map, and the exportable mission report.

## 6. Methodology

The end-to-end methodology followed during development was:

1. Acquisition of side-scan sonar waterfall imagery (port and starboard channels) from an AUV or towed sensor package.
2. Preprocessing via CLAHE-based contrast normalization together with sonar-appropriate data augmentation (mosaic, blur, grayscale conversion) during training.
3. Detection and coarse classification of anomalies using the YOLOv8n backbone, with a per-detection confidence score.
4. Acoustic-shadow-based estimation of target height, corrected for instantaneous vehicle pitch and roll, per the relation in Section 4.1.
5. Refinement of anomaly category using the secondary Marine Pulse classifier.
6. Geotagging of all retained detections and rendering on the live tactical map.
7. Generation of a single, exportable mission report (CSV, with a client-side PDF report generator) enumerating detections, confidence scores, and coordinates, ordered by hazard priority.

---

## 7. Experimental Validation

The detection and classification models were validated against three independent, publicly available sonar/marine-anomaly datasets rather than a single internal split, in order to expose class-level and dataset-level variance.

| Dataset | Metric | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Seabed (side-scan sonar debris) | Debris detection mAP50 | 0.85 |
| AI4Shipwreck | mAP50-95 (clean 100-epoch convergence run) | 0.58 |
| Marine Pulse | Classification accuracy (n = 190) | 94.2% |

### 7.1 Known Limitations

Consistent with the project's emphasis on transparent reporting, the following limitations are explicitly acknowledged rather than obscured:

- **Shipwreck detection** was evaluated on only four unique images in the AI4Shipwreck split, implying a non-trivial risk of high variance in the reported metric.
- The Marine Pulse classification model, at 44.8 MB, is approximately seven times larger than the primary detector, and its inference latency on target embedded hardware (e.g., Jetson-class devices) has not yet been benchmarked.
- No hardware-in-the-loop testing has yet been conducted on the intended target embedded platform.

> **Note:** Ghost-net detection was previously the weakest-performing category (mAP50 ≈ 0.08) due to class imbalance and limited training epochs. This has since been resolved through extended, class-weighted training and expanded labeled ghost-net imagery.

### 7.2 Planned Mitigations

- Broaden the shipwreck training set across additional scenes to reduce estimator variance.
- Profile the Marine Pulse classifier on target embedded hardware, with quantization or distillation applied if onboard (rather than post-mission) execution is required.
- Conduct full hardware-in-the-loop benchmarking (e.g., Jetson-class device with TensorRT INT8 quantization) for both the detection and classification stages prior to field deployment.

## 8. Prototype Status

The operator dashboard is fully implemented and comprises eight functional modules: live sonar waterfall display, acoustic analysis studio, GIS tactical map, synthetic-data studio, edge/NPU telemetry benchmarking, subsea hardware simulator, mission report generator, and a guided walkthrough for evaluators. The trained and validated detection/classification models described in Section 7 are in the process of being integrated into this frontend as the live inference backend, in place of the simulated data used during interface development. The FastAPI service already exposes the full inference contract (Section 11) and falls back to a deterministic mock detection when model weights are not mounted, so the dashboard remains fully exercisable end-to-end during this integration phase.
